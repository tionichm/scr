# scr
data condensation module
consists out of three main objects:
Snake_Searcher which uses the chi-squared test to find 'flat zones' and extract
  them.
Data_Chomper condenses the extracted arrays into a single point with statistics
Rebuilder (*Application specific*) matches equilibria. (not useful for people
  other than myself :) )
